```

### 6. Run Full Demo
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/full-demo.js
```

## 🧪 Test Coverage

✅ **28 passing tests** covering:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Single and batch certificate minting
- Soulbound token behavior (non-transferable)
- Certificate verification and validation
- Access control and permissions
- Certificate management (revocation, burning)
- Edge cases and error handling
- Gas optimization testing

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Core Soulbound Properties
- ✅ Non-transferable certificates
- ✅ Non-approvable tokens
- ✅ Permanent binding to recipients
- ✅ Revocation capabilities
- ✅ Burning functionality

### Certificate Management
- ✅ Individual certificate minting
- ✅ Batch certificate minting (up to 100 at once)
- ✅ Detailed certificate metadata storage
- ✅ Certificate type categorization
- ✅ Grade and course information
- ✅ Timestamp tracking

### Verification System
- ✅ Public certificate verification
- ✅ Detailed certificate information access
- ✅ Certificate validity checking
- ✅ Type-based certificate queries

### Security Features
- ✅ Owner-only minting
- ✅ Access-controlled certificate details
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Event logging for transparency

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Operation | Gas Cost | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Single Mint | ~200,000 gas | ✅ Optimized |
| Batch Mint (50) | ~7.7M gas | ✅ Efficient |
| Certificate Verification | ~30,000 gas | ✅ Lightweight |
| Certificate Revocation | ~50,000 gas | ✅ Standard |

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Solidity 0.8.20
- **Framework**: Hardhat 2.22.0
- **Testing**: Mocha/Chai with Hardhat Network Helpers
- **Libraries**: OpenZeppelin Contracts 5.4.0
- **Standards**: ERC-721 (Extended for Soulbound)

## 🎉 Demo Results

The `full-demo.js` script successfully demonstrates:
1. ✅ Contract deployment
2. ✅ Single certificate minting (2 certificates)
3. ✅ Batch certificate minting (3 certificates)
4. ✅ Certificate verification (5 tokens verified)
5. ✅ Soulbound property enforcement (transfers blocked)
6. ✅ Certificate management (revocation, updates)
7. ✅ Access control validation
8. ✅ Certificate burning functionality

## 🛡️ Security Validation

All security features tested and working:
- ✅ Transfer prevention enforced
- ✅ Approval mechanisms disabled  
- ✅ Owner-only minting enforced
- ✅ Access controls validated
- ✅ Input validation working
- ✅ Reentrancy protection active

## 📈 Next Steps

The contract is production-ready for:
1. **Testnet Deployment** (Goerli, Sepolia)
2. **Security Audit** (recommended before mainnet)
3. **Frontend Integration** (Web3 dApp)
4. **IPFS Integration** (for metadata storage)
5. **Multi-signature Setup** (for production owner)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

- ✅ All 28 tests passing
- ✅ Contract successfully compiled
- ✅ Local deployment working
- ✅ All features demonstrated working
- ✅ Gas optimization implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided
- ✅ Security measures validated
